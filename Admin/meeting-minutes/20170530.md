### Weekly meeting - 30/05/2017
#### attendees : Sasa, John, Mike

##### Casaer Cipher
- posibly use integer values as input rather than binary? Requires the NNet to train itself to recognise binary operations, rather than mathematical stuff
- ACTION: bit flips on data, need to check than any high values are switched to lower values for cipher generation

##### Encryption
- OpenSSL returning text data that is not in correct format - strings become much longer than they should be for e.g. DES
- ACTION: send command ued for openSSL to Sasa, could be the base64 issue
- ACTION: look at xxd, used to read base64 files
- ACTION: Check random samples of data - somewhat done
- ACTION: check plaintext encodings! DONE

##### NNets
- ACTION: design and begin build of discriminator
- Possibly try to do longer bit strings for casaer cipher if needed, see what that does to it.
